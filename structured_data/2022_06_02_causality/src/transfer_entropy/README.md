## Purpose of this folder
We advocate to use the [PyCausality](https://pypi.org/project/PyCausality/) package when working with Transfer Entropy. 
The code itself is not maintained anymore but still works well. 
Because the pip package might become/is unstable, we copied the source code and created a wrapper around it.
See [the example notebook](./../Example%20notebook.ipynb) for inspiration to integrate this code in your own project!
