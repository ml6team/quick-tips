# Neural Keyword Extraction

Advancements in neural networks are applied to an ever growing number of natural language processing problems. Keyword extraction is no exception. The emerging subcategory, dubbed ***neural* keyword extraction** 🧠, often uses sequence-to-sequence models, whose objective is to transform a sequence of input words into an abstract intermediate representation and from it generate a sequence of keywords.

This is in contrast to classical keyword extraction which is often graph-based and utilises linguistic 💬 or statistical 📊 features.

💡 In this quick-tip we look at two approaches that fall into the category of neural keyword extraction.
