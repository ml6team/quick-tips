    "In a [pervious quick tip](https://github.com/ml6team/quick-tips/tree/main/nlp/2021_03_18_pke_keyword_extraction) we looked at [**pke**](https://boudinfl.github.io/pke/build/html/index.html) as a replacement for Gensim's [recently removed keyword extraction module](https://github.com/RaRe-Technologies/gensim/releases/tag/4.0.0).\n",
    "pke comes with batteries included: \n",
    "\n",
    "* It has **preprocessing build in**, \n",
    "* supports **non-English languages**, and \n",
    "* provides a **wide range of keyword extraction methods**: statistical, graph-based, and supervised.\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes pke a **great choice to get started** with keyword extraction, experiment with different methods and generate baselines to improve upon.\n",

    "\n",
    "## The Future of Keyword Extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "Newly-developed auspicious extraction methods fall into the category of **neural keyword extraction**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The methods often utilise **sequence-to-sequence models** based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). Their objective is to transform a sequence of input words (the given document) into an abstract intermediate representation and generate a sequence of keywords from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "These models do not use words or phrases directly, which enables them to generate unseen keywords as well. This is called **keyword generation** and combines abstractive as well as extractive keywords.\n",
    "\n",
    "They report **impressive performance** increases over the classical extraction methods. However, training such models **requires a large collection of documents** and annotated keywords, since the final training step is usually supervised.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, many of the models' repositories are not well maintained which makes it **difficult to train** them, especially on different languages or domains. \n",
    "\n",
    "This leaves the quesition of how neural keyword extraction can already be used today.\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow the below sections in this notebook to learn how to use **two approaches in the neural keyword extraction category** and how they compare to classical extraction methods. 👇"

    "Nonetheless the **underlying idea** is as clever as it is simple: It compares embeddings of words with embeddings of texts and selects the set of keywords which are most similar to the entire text.\n",

    "\n",
    "This notebook gave a brief overview of neural keyword extraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If an annotated dataset is available or if the problem domain is closely related to one of the existing dataset and it's possible to invest some time into training a model yourself, neural keyword extraction **promises great performance**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* We further presented two approaches that are readily available: **KeyBERT** uses the **similarity** between word and text **embeddings** to find keywords which best describe a text and an **end-to-end neural keyword extraction model** based on BART.\n",
    "\n",
    "👉 For now, we recommend to first try `pke` to establish a solid baseline and explore the mentioned extraction methods as an addition.\n",
