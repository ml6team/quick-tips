# Neural Keyword Extraction

Advancements in neural networks are applied to an ever growing number of natural language processing problems. Keyword extraction is no exception. The emerging subcategory, dubbed ***neural* keyword extraction** ðŸ§ , often uses sequence-to-sequence models, whose objective is to transform a sequence of input words into an abstract intermediate representation and from it generate a sequence of keywords.

This is in contrast to classical keyword extraction which is often graph-based and utilises linguistic ðŸ’¬ or statistical ðŸ“Š features.

ðŸ’¡ In this quick-tip we look at two approaches that fall into the category of neural keyword extraction.

We recommend to open the notebook using Colab for an interactive explainable experience and optimal rendering of the visuals ðŸ‘‡:
