# Text Augmentation using large-scale LMs and prompt engineering

Typically, the more data we have, the better performance we can achieve ðŸ¤™. However, it is sometimes difficult and/or expensive to annotate a large amount of training data ðŸ˜ž. Therefore, proper data augmentation is useful to boost the model performance.

Large-scale language models (LMs) are excellent few-shot learners, allowing them to be controlled via natural text prompts. In this tip, we leverage three large-scale LMs (GPT-3, GPT-J and GPT-Neo) and prompt engineering to generate very realistic samples from a very small dataset. The model takes as input two real samples from our dataset, embeds them in a carefully designed prompt and generates an augmented mixed sample influenced by the sample sentences. We use the [Emotion](https://huggingface.co/datasets/emotion) dataset and distilled BERT pre-trained model and show that this augmentation method boosts the model performance and generates very realistic samples. For more information on text augmentation using large-scale LMs check [GPT3Mix](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.08826.pdf).
